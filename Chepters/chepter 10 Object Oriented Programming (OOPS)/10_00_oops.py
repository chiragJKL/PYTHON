# # OOPs = Object Oriented Programmings

# *************************************************************************

# Class =
# A class is a blueprint for creating objects. ex] railway form blueprint
# class is in Pascal Case--> EmployeeName
#     not in Camel Case--> employeeName

# *************************************************************************

# Object =
# An object is an instantiation of a class. When class is defined, a template(info) is defined. Memory is allocated only after object instantiation.

# Objects of a given class can invoke the methods available to it without revealing the implementation details to the user.

# Abstraction = simplyfied lingo
#  &
# Encapsulation = same things raped together!

# *************************************************************************

# Modelling a problem in OOPs =

# We identify the following in our problem

# Noun -> Class -> Employee ; black form
# Adjective -> Attributes -> name,age,salary ; details we put
# Verbs -> Methods -> getSalary(), increment() ; easily put details
