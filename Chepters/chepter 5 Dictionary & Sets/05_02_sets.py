# # sets : {} is used,  in which values won't repeat

# ***Properties of Sets

# Sets are unordered
# Elements order doesnâ€™t matter
# Sets are unindexed
# Cannot access elements by index
# There is no way to change items in sets (even if we try to put list inside sets it will throw an error)
# Sets cannot contain duplicate values

a = {1, 2, 5, 2}

print(type(a))  # class -> set
print(a)  # 2 won't repeat
